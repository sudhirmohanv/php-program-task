what is Api:-
*****************
Api stands ofr Appliction programming interface 
Api is a mechanism by using which one type Appliction can communicate whith Another
Appliction.
In general api is very big topic 

Api are used by defferent Appliction to data from one platefrom to another platefrom
worldmeter .com corona virus Api
any Appliction A,B,C,D,E,F,G can utilise the Api of worldmeter.com to get live update of corona.

1..interoperability : conversion of one type of language to soeme common language so that data con be exchange without derectly 
conerting the one language to another language

Interoperability refers to shoarig of data from one Appliction to Another Appliction
without changeing native language ,by means of some common Intercoversion language
or 
sharing of data from one App to another App without derectly coverting native language is called interoperability.


for Eg:
Android --->json--->java
python --->json--->java
python --->json--->php
php --->json--->SQL

maain feature of interoperability is platefrom indepent native.

php-->(serialisation/json Encoding )-->json ---(Deseriasation/json Decode)->SQL
serialisation/json Encoding : converting one type PL. to JSON object
Deseriasation/json Decode : converting JSON type to one type data-type of PL

EG:
php---> json_decde() ---->json (serialiation)
Associativ Array  ----> json 

json ---> json_decode() ---> Associativ Array. (De-serialiation) 

what is web-service.:-any type of service over the internet  is termed as web-service,  it can be any type
of service and can use any protocol.


what is web-Api.:-
the Api which can be accessed only via web interface internet as a medium  is called
as web-Api
java Appliction ---->orecal local DB

		localDriver Api
game Appliction ------>Sound drever
			Audio Api

Every web-api is Api not every Api is web-Api

what is soap.:--
it is type of web-Api which can used be used, to transport data/represent the data ,in fromSimpaleobject Access protocal which used 
XML DAta representation.

Eg:
<XML:nmps="version/XML-document-4">
		<xml:Envelope>
		       <Employee>
					<user id="1">
								<email><sudhir@gmail.com</email>
								<passwrod>1234</passwrod>
						</user>
					</Employee>	
				</Envelope>
</xml>
used for very heavy data transmission.
Soap is highly Scalable
Soap is secure, why because you access nth node for access real node 
Soap Architecture can very very deep that it can be very complex to handle
				

what is REST.:-

REST:stands for reperetational state transfer,
it is type of web-api which work under http protocol.
its representation is always in json fromat
it will very very light weight,
Easy to handle due to oreganised data stuctire in  from of key and value paire

Request : GET
Request : POST
Request : options
Request : PATCH
Request : PUT
Request : DELETE
Request : LOCK
Request : HEAD
...

...

...

{
"type":"GET",
"version":"1.0.1",
"status":"true",
"error":"false",
"code":200,
"data":[

			{"empid":1001,"name":"sudhir","salary":10000},
			{"empid":1002,"name":"vipin","salary":70000},
			{"empid":1003,"name":"mohan","salary":40000},
			{"empid":1004,"name":"Reetesh","salary":20000},
			{"empid":1005,"name":"Akash","salary":50000},


]
"keyword",[],
}


what is postman.:-
what is postman is a client tool send the pure http request to the server.
and testing Api's.
postman has set of http method to intersepct the REST API,by using GET,POST ,PIT,PATCH,DELETE...
and also ha different payloads which can be binded as header, and body content.


what is defference B/w REST & SOAP.:=>
***********************************
1.rest : Respresntational state transfer
1.soap : simple object Access protocal


2.Rest : uses lower bandwith
2.Soap : uses Higher Bandwith

3.Rest : its follows web-standards related http protocal
3.Soap : its follows XML structure and conventions.based on Envelope and web standards.

4. REST : lower security
4.soap : Higher security

5.Rest : Easy to handle, easy to deserialise and serialise
5.Soap : very difficult to handle,

6. Rest : data representation is  in json,yml
6. soap : data representation is  in XML

Api Related terms:-
**********************
=>1. http method : these are set of method which are defined to perform some
unique operation
in rest Api 
http methds are reqivalent DB operation

C : create the data HTTP/1.1 POST
R : read the data HTTP/1.1 GET 
U : update the data HTTP/1.1 PUT AND PATCH
			PUT : full update
			PATCH : partial update
D : Delete the data HTTP/1.1 DELETE

HTTP has two version 1.1 and 2.1
headers :- are the type of payload (infometion) attached to request before data .
		headers con contain infometion like ,http satus : 200, or 404, 500
		header has content Information like content-type :text/html content-type:
		appliction/json ,content-type:Image:jpeg all these are called MIME type
		header has allowed methds : GET,POST,....
		header con be used to check if request are Authenitic or not
		header con be used to enable core policy (cotent origin request security policy)
 
Body Content :- it refers to form data , supplied from ,or any client like postman 
				type of body data
				1.formdata : form
				2.urlencoded : data
				3.www-encoded data
				4.raw data : json

	****	full form  *****
2. jwt: json web token
3. why is by default expiry time of jwt ? 20 minute
4. what is use tiken ?
		for Authentication purpose.
 
 
 
 1. method spoofing :

form : method --> get | post
postman : request --> formdata --> get or post
form  : get,post
put 1. Raw data 
Delete 1 : Raw data

Get : formdata ,raw data
post : formdat , raw data

put => data raw ---> Request: PUT
delete => data raw ---> Raw Request : DELETE

formdata = PUT => method : post and _method = PUT => data :formdata

2. JWT:- Json web token
3. why is by default expiry time of jwt ? 20 Minute.
4. What is use Token ?
    for Authentication Purpose.
